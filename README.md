## What is this?
This is a `Backbone.js` in depth study, or say, analysis on `Backbone.js` source code.

## Why is this?
For the following reasons:

- Backbone is small, concrete and simple. 
- The design of Backbone is delicate, and worth learning.
- To get a deeper understanding of MVC pattern.

## Who is This For?
Basically, for myself. If you happened to see it, and are interested in the implementation of Backbone, it might be helpful.
Note that this is not a Backbone tutorial. If you're new to Backbone, take the Docs on [official website](http://backbonejs.org/).
